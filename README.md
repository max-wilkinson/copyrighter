# Copyrighter

Copyrighter is a VS Code extension that can automatically include your copyright and license (if you have one) in your source code.

## Background

Manually including a copyright and license takes time and cognitive energy away from coding. By automating the process, you are free to focus on doing what you love - building software!

## Features

When you open a supported file type, Copyrighter will automatically add your copyright notice (and optional license), if they are missing.

New files will be created with the copyright notice (and optional license) automatically injected at the top of the file.

You can utilize the VS Code command "Add Copyright", to manually add your copyright notice to the current file.

## Requirements

This extension is designed to work right out of the box. No configuration is required in order to get started.

However, there are a couple extension settings (documented below) that you can utilize to enhance the experience.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `copyrighter.author`: Set the author that holds the copyright
- `copyrighter.license`: Select a license header to include with your copyright. If no license is selected, then only the copyright will be added to files.

## Release Notes

Copyrighter is in public beta. We are hard at work creating the best experience possible for this extension. If you have any feedback feel free to submit an issue to this repository.
